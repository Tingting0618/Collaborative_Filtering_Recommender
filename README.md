# Collaborative Filtering Recommender

## Goal

The goal of this project is to practice Collaborative Filtering and recommend a movie to Toby based on his view history and other users who are similar to Toby. 

## Collaborative Filtering

- User-based, which measures the similarity between target users and other users.
- Item-based, which measures the similarity between the items that target users rate or interact with and other items.

## Reference:
The notebook is based on a [blog post](http://tungwaiyip.info/2012/Collaborative%20Filtering.html)., which is based on the book Toby Seragan's book Programming Collective Intelligence.
